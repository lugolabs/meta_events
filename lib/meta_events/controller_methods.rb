    # normal prefix (_i.e._, +foo_bar+, not +ab1_foo_bar+).

    # You declare the frontend event here, on the server side; the server renders into the page this very binding,
    # and the frontend JavaScript (+meta_events.js.erb+) can pick up that data and expose it by very easy-to-use
    # JavaScript functions.
